\section*{Problem 2}
We have to show the bound
\[
    \int_{(-A + \tfrac 12)} \Gamma(s) x^s \dc s \ll \frac{x^{-A +
    1/2}}{(A-1)!}.
\]
Note that the integral exists by the rapid decay of $\Gamma$ along vertical
lines. However, we cannot apply Stirling's formula to bound the integral directly
as Stirling a priori only gives uniform bounds in regions of the form $\abs{\arg(s)
- \pi} \geq \delta > 0$. We can however apply stirlings formula if we apply the recurrence
$s\Gamma(s) = \Gamma(s+1)$ repeatedly: 
\begin{multline*}
    \int_{(-A+1/2)} \Gamma(s) x^s \dc s \ll 
    \int_{(-A+1/2)} \abs{\Gamma(s) x^s} \dc s \ll 
    x^{-A+1/2} \int_{(1/2)} \abs{\Gamma(s-A)} \dc s \\ 
    = x^{-A+1/2} \int_{(1/2)} \abs{\frac {\Gamma(s)}{(s-A+1) \cdots (s-1)}}
    \dc s \leq \frac{x^{-A + 1/2}}{(A-1)!} \int_{(1/2)} \abs{\Gamma(s)} \dc s. 
\end{multline*}

\textbf{Notes.}
Once we know this inequality, we actually can do better: Remember that $\Gamma$ has poles at
the negative integers, the residue at $-n$ is given by $\tfrac{(-1)^n}{n!}$. Hence for 
(large) $T > 0$, we have that 
\[
    \int_{1/2-A-\ic T}^{1/2 - A +\ic T} \Gamma(s) x^s \dc s =
    2 \pi \ic \frac{(-x)^{-A}}{A!} + \int_{1/2-A-\ic T}^{-1/2 - A + \ic T} \Gamma(s) x^s
    \dc s + O\left( \int_{1/2-A-\ic T}^{-1/2-A - \ic T}  \Gamma(s) x^s \dc s\right). 
\]
By the rapid decay of $\Gamma$, the horizontal integral vanishes as $T
\rightarrow \infty$, and we can bound the vertical integral using what we
showed before, applied to $A+1$. This yields
\[
    \int_{(-A+1/2)} \Gamma(s) x^s \dc s = 2 \pi \ic \frac{(-x)^{-A}}{A!} + O\left(\frac{x^{-A-1/2}}{A!}\right).
\]
In fact, as for every $x>0$ the fraction $x^A/A!$ tends to zero as $A \to \infty$, we
may repeat this as often as we want, obtaining
\[
    \frac 1{2 \pi \ic} \int_{(-A+1/2)} \Gamma(s) x^s \dc s = \sum_{k=A}^\infty \frac{(-x)^{-k}}{k!} 
    = \ec^{-\frac 1x} - \sum_{k=0}^{A-1} \frac{(-x)^{-k}}{k!}.
\]
The equation for $A= 0$ is nothing new! As $\Gamma(s)$ is holomorphic
for $\Re s > 0$ we already know that
\[
    \ec^{-1/x} = \frac{1}{2 \pi \ic} \int_{(1/2)} \cM(\ec^{1/x})(s) \frac{x^s}s \dc s
    = \frac{1}{2 \pi \ic} \int_{(1/2)} \frac{\Gamma(s+1)}{s} x^s \dc s.
\]
