# Exercise Sessions in Analytic Number Theory 
##### Wednesdays 8-10, WiSe 22/23, Uni Bonn

## Announcements
* From now on we will meet at 8:30!

## Solutions to the exercise sheets
Warning: These are non-official, there might be errors. 
* A full solution to Sheet 0 can be found on pages 6ff in Brüdern's _Einführung in die analytische Zahlentheorie_ (german), or (in a slightly different form) on the first few pages of Tenenbaum's _Introduction to analytic and probabilistic number theory._  
* [Sheet 1](Sheet1/Sheet1.pdf)
* [Sheet 2](Sheet2/Sheet2.pdf)
* [Sheet 3](Sheet3/Sheet3.pdf) + some facts on multiplicative groups mod q.
* [Sheet 4](Sheet4/Sheet4.pdf)
* [Sheet 5](Sheet5/Sheet5.pdf)
* [Sheet 6](Sheet6/Sheet6.pdf) Bounds for ζ and L(s,χ) can be found here.
* [Sheet 7](Sheet7/Sheet7.pdf) Some fun with Cesàro weights in exercise 4!

## Other Texts
* [Notes on the approximate functional equation](ApproxFuncEq/ApproxFuncEq.pdf)
