# Exercise Sessions in Analytic Number Theory 
##### Wednesdays 8-10, WiSe 22/23, Uni Bonn

## Solutions to the exercise sheets
Warning: These are non-official, there might be errors. Also, this would not have been
have been possible if I didn't have access to my former tutor's solutions 
from 2019, when I took a similar course in Göttingen.

* A full solution to Sheet 0 can be found on pages 6ff in Brüdern's _Einführung
  in die analytische Zahlentheorie_ (german), or (in a slightly different form)
  on the first few pages of Tenenbaum's _Introduction to analytic and
  probabilistic number theory._  
* [Sheet 1](Sheet01/Sheet1.pdf)
* [Sheet 2](Sheet02/Sheet2.pdf)
* [Sheet 3](Sheet03/Sheet3.pdf) + some facts on multiplicative groups mod q.
* [Sheet 4](Sheet04/Sheet4.pdf)
* [Sheet 5](Sheet05/Sheet5.pdf)
* [Sheet 6](Sheet06/Sheet6.pdf) Bounds for ζ and L(s,χ) can be found here.
* [Sheet 7](Sheet07/Sheet7.pdf) More examples for applications of Perron's formula, and some fun with Cesàro weights in exercise 4!
* [Sheet 8](Sheet08/Sheet8.pdf) 
* [Sheet 9](Sheet09/Sheet9.pdf) 
* [Sheet 10](Sheet10/Sheet10.pdf) 


## Other Texts
